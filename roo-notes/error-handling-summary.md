# Enhanced Error Handling for CRM Integration

## Overview

This document summarizes the enhanced error handling and credential management capabilities implemented for the REanna Router CRM integration via the Rollout API. These improvements significantly increase reliability, security, and operational visibility of the integration.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Robust Error Handling

The updated implementation includes intelligent error handling with distinguished error types:

- **RolloutError** - Base exception for all Rollout API errors
- **RolloutAuthError** - Authentication-specific failures
- **RolloutRateLimitError** - Rate limit exceeded errors
- **RolloutServerError** - Server-side errors (5xx status codes)
- **RolloutCircuitOpenError** - Errors when circuit breaker is open due to repeated failures

Each error type triggers specific handling strategies, improving system resilience.

### 2. Automatic Retry with Exponential Backoff

All API operations now include automatic retry capability:

- Configurable maximum retry attempts (default: 5)
- Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Different backoff strategies based on error type:
  - Longer delays for rate limit errors
  - Short delays for transient server errors
  - No retries for client validation errors or circuit breaker open errors
  
```python
# Example retry pattern
delay = min(MAX_BACKOFF, BASE_BACKOFF * (2 ** retry_count))
jitter = random.uniform(0, delay)
```

### 3. Token Lifecycle Management

JWT tokens are now managed more effectively:

- Automatic token refresh when approaching expiration
- Token expiry tracking to prevent unnecessary refreshes
- Jittered expiration times to avoid simultaneous refresh storms
- Unique token identifiers for better tracing

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern

The system now implements the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures:

- Separate circuit breakers for API calls and MCP server calls
- Configurable failure thresholds (defaults: 3 for API, 5 for MCP)
- Automatic transition to open state after threshold is reached
- Recovery timeout with half-open state to test service availability
- Graceful handling of circuit open conditions in all API routes

```python
# Circuit breaker state transitions
CLOSED → (failures reach threshold) → OPEN
OPEN → (timeout expires) → HALF-OPEN
HALF-OPEN → (successful calls) → CLOSED
HALF-OPEN → (failed call) → OPEN
```

Circuit breaker benefits:
- Prevents overwhelming failing dependencies
- Avoids cascading failures throughout the system
- Creates predictable failure behavior
- Allows self-healing without manual intervention
- Provides clear feedback about system health

The implementation excludes rate limit errors from circuit breaker failures since these are expected and handled separately.

### 4. Secure Credential Storage

A new credential management system provides:

- Encrypted storage of API credentials
- Secure file permissions to prevent unauthorized access
- In-memory protection of sensitive credential data
- Separation of credential retrieval from credential usage

### 5. Graceful Error Recovery

The notification and tour services now gracefully handle errors:

- Failed operations don't crash the entire workflow
- Detailed error reporting for operational visibility
- Automatic rescheduling of failed operations when appropriate
- Stateful tracking of sync operations

### Key Methods

- `call_api()` - Main API method with retry logic
- `_handle_rate_limiting()` - Rate limit detection and management
- `_check_token_expiry()` - Automatic token refresh
- `sync_tour_to_crm()` - Enhanced tour sync with better error handling
- `CircuitBreaker.execute()` - Protected execution with circuit breaking
- `store_credentials()` - Secure storage for API credentials

## Usage Example

```python
# Using the enhanced error handling
try:
    result = await rollout_client.sync_feedback(
        property_id=property_id,
        tour_id=tour_id,
        feedback=feedback
    )
    # Success handling
except RolloutRateLimitError as e:
    # Rate limit specific handling
except RolloutCircuitOpenError as e:
    # Circuit breaker handling
    # e.g., schedule retry after rate limit resets
except RolloutAuthError as e:
    # Authentication error handling
    # e.g., refresh credentials and retry
except RolloutError as e:
    # General error handling
```


## Next Steps

1. **Monitoring System**: Implement comprehensive API usage tracking
2. **Admin Dashboard**: Create UI for viewing sync status and manual retries
3. **Alert System**: Set up alerts for repeated failures
4. **Unit Testing**: Develop tests for error scenarios

## Conclusion

The enhanced error handling significantly improves the reliability and resilience of the CRM integration. By intelligently handling different error scenarios, automatically retrying operations, and securely managing credentials, the system can withstand common API integration challenges while providing better visibility into operational status.
