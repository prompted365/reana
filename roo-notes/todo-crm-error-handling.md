# Enhanced Error Handling To-Do List

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Add specific exception classes for Rollout API errors
- [x] Implement exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- [x] Add rate limiting detection and handling
- [x] Improve JWT token management with automatic refresh
- [x] Create secure credential storage utilities
- [x] Update notification service to handle errors gracefully
- [x] Update tour routes to handle CRM sync errors
- [x] Create test script to demonstrate retry logic

## Future Tasks
- [x] Implement monitoring system for API usage and rate limits
- [x] Create admin UI for viewing sync status and retrying failed syncs
- [x] Create a dashboard for API usage statistics
- [x] Set up alerts for repeated sync failures
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for error handling
- [x] Implement circuit breaker pattern for Rollout API calls
- [x] Add performance metrics collection for API calls
- [ ] Implement automated cleanup of expired tokens

## Integration Testing Scenarios
- [ ] Test successful synchronization flow
- [ ] Test rate limiting error handling
- [ ] Test authentication failure recovery
- [ ] Test with network interruptions
- [x] Test with malformed API responses
- [ ] Test credential rotation

## Dashboard Testing
- [x] Create a test script to generate monitoring data
- [x] Create a test script to simulate failed operations
- [x] Implement a browser-based testing workflow
- [ ] Add automated UI tests for the dashboard

## Deployment Recommendations
- [ ] Use a process manager (e.g., Supervisor, PM2) for running in production
- [x] Set up monitoring alerts based on dashboard metrics
- [ ] Configure automatic restart on failure
- [ ] Implement continuous integration testing
