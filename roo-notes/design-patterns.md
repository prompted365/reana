# REanna Router - Design Patterns & Architectural Considerations

This document outlines the architectural patterns, design considerations, and best practices used in the REanna Router system. It serves as a guide to understanding the system's architecture and provides recommendations for maintaining and extending the system.

## 1. Architectural Patterns

### 1.1 Layered Architecture

REanna Router uses a classic layered architecture pattern to separate concerns and ensure modularity:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Layer] --> B[Service Layer]
    B --> C[Model Layer]
    C --> D[Database Layer]
```

- **API Layer**: FastAPI routes and controllers that handle HTTP requests
- **Service Layer**: Business logic that orchestrates operations
- **Model Layer**: Data models and validation using Pydantic
- **Database Layer**: Data access and storage using SQLite

Benefits of this approach:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing of individual layers
- Improved maintainability and extensibility
- Ability to change implementations within a layer with minimal impact on other layers

### 1.2 Task-Based Architecture

A key innovation in REanna Router is its task-based architecture, which maps Google Cloud Fleet Routing "shipments" to discrete tasks in the system:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Tour] --> B[Property Visits]
    B --> C[Tasks]
    C --> D[Feedback]
    
    E[Google API Shipment] -.maps to.-> C
```

This pattern:

- Breaks complex workflows into discrete, manageable tasks
- Allows for parallel processing of tasks
- Facilitates tracking of task status and progress
- Enables flexible scheduling and rescheduling

### 1.3 Event-Driven Architecture

For certain operations, particularly feedback collection and processing, the system employs an event-driven approach:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Task Completion
    participant Feedback Service
    participant Notification Service
    
    Task Completion->>Feedback Service: Task Completed Event
    Feedback Service->>Feedback Service: Collect Feedback
    Feedback Service->>Feedback Service: Process Feedback
    Feedback Service->>Notification Service: Feedback Ready Event
    Notification Service->>Notification Service: Send Notification
```

This pattern:

- Reduces coupling between components
- Enables asynchronous processing
- Allows for easy addition of new event handlers
- Provides natural extension points for the system

### 1.4 Repository Pattern

For database operations, the system uses a simplified repository pattern:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[API Routes] --> B[Model Functions]
    B --> C[Database Connection]
```

Each model has its own set of functions for CRUD operations, which encapsulate SQL queries and database interactions. This pattern:

- Centralizes data access logic
- Abstracts database operations
- Provides a consistent interface for data access
- Makes it easier to change the database implementation

## 2. Design Patterns

### 2.1 Factory Pattern

The system uses factory functions to create new instances of models:

```python
def create_tour(tour: TourCreate) -> Tour:
    """Create a new tour in the database."""
    tour_id = generate_id()
    now = current_timestamp()
    
    # Database operations...
    
    return Tour(
        id=tour_id,
        agent_id=tour.agent_id,
        # Other fields...
    )
```

This pattern:

- Encapsulates object creation logic
- Ensures proper initialization of objects
- Centralizes ID generation and timestamp creation
- Makes it easier to modify creation logic in the future

### 2.2 Strategy Pattern

For route optimization, the system employs a simplified strategy pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Optimize Tour] --> B{Optimization Strategy}
    B -->|Optimize| C[Optimize for Efficiency]
    B -->|Furthest First| D[Optimize Furthest First]
    B -->|Closest First| E[Optimize Closest First]
```

This allows for different optimization approaches based on agent preferences, which could be extended in the future.

### 2.3 Command Pattern

Task execution follows a command pattern, where each task represents a command to be executed:

```python
class TaskType(str, Enum):
    PROPERTY_TOUR = "property_tour"
    FEEDBACK_COLLECTION = "feedback_collection"
    LISTING_AGENT_NOTIFICATION = "listing_agent_notification"
    BUYER_FOLLOWUP = "buyer_followup"
```

Each task type has its own handler in the service layer, which knows how to execute that specific type of task.

### 2.4 Observer Pattern

The feedback notification system implements a simplified observer pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Feedback Created] --> B[Feedback Service]
    B --> C[Process Feedback]
    C --> D[Notify Observers]
    D --> E[Listing Agent]
    D --> F[Buyer]
    D --> G[Selling Agent]
```

When feedback is collected and processed, the system notifies interested parties based on their preferences.

### 2.5 Context Manager Pattern

For database connections, the system uses a context manager pattern:

```python
@contextmanager
def get_db_connection():
    """Context manager for database connections."""
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)
    conn.row_factory = dict_factory
    conn.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON")
    try:
        yield conn
    finally:
        conn.close()
```

This ensures proper resource management and exception handling for database connections.

## 3. Implementation Patterns

### 3.1 Dependency Injection

While not using a formal dependency injection framework, the system employs manual dependency injection through function parameters:

```python
@router.get("/{tour_id}/journal", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
async def get_tour_journal_entries(tour_id: str):
    """
    Get the journal entries for a tour.
    """
    tour = get_tour(tour_id)
    # ...
    
    # Get the tour journal
    from app.services import get_tour_journal
    journal = await get_tour_journal(tour_id)
    
    return {
        "tour_id": tour_id,
        "journal_entries": journal
    }
```

This approach:

- Makes dependencies explicit
- Facilitates testing through mocking
- Keeps functions loosely coupled
- Provides clarity about required dependencies

### 3.2 Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

The system uses Pydantic models as DTOs to validate and transform data between layers:

```python
class TourBase(BaseModel):
    agent_id: str
    start_time: str
    end_time: str
    status: str = "scheduled"

class TourCreate(TourBase):
    pass

class Tour(TourBase):
    id: str
    route_data: Optional[str] = None
    created_at: str
    updated_at: str
```

This pattern:

- Ensures data validation at boundaries
- Provides clear contracts between layers
- Enables automatic documentation of data structures
- Supports serialization and deserialization

### 3.3 Asynchronous Processing

For operations that can be performed in parallel or need to be non-blocking, the system uses async/await:

```python
async def trigger_feedback_collection(task_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ...
    
    # Initiate feedback collection methods in parallel
    collection_tasks = []
    for method in feedback_methods:
        if method == "sms":
            collection_tasks.append(collect_sms_feedback(feedback_task.id, property_visit.id))
        elif method == "voice":
            collection_tasks.append(collect_voice_feedback(feedback_task.id, property_visit.id))
    
    # Run feedback collection methods in parallel
    await asyncio.gather(*collection_tasks)
    
    return {
        "status": "feedback_collection_initiated",
        "feedback_task_id": feedback_task.id
    }
```

This approach:

- Improves performance for I/O-bound operations
- Allows for parallel execution of independent tasks
- Provides better resource utilization
- Enables handling of concurrent requests efficiently

### 3.4 Service Layer Pattern

Business logic is encapsulated in service modules, which coordinate operations across models:

```python
def optimize_tour(
    tour: Tour,
    properties: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    agent_home: str
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Geocode agent home
    agent_coords = geocode_address(agent_home)
    
    # Map properties to shipments
    request_body, shipment_to_visit_map = map_properties_to_shipments(tour, properties, agent_coords)
    
    # Call the optimization API
    api_response = call_route_optimization_api(request_body)
    
    # Parse the response
    result = parse_optimization_response(api_response, shipment_to_visit_map)
    
    return result
```

This pattern:

- Centralizes business logic
- Coordinates operations across multiple models
- Keeps API routes lean and focused on request handling
- Facilitates reuse of business logic across different API endpoints

## 4. Error Handling Patterns

### 4.1 Exception-Based Error Handling

The system uses exceptions to handle errors and provides consistent error responses:

```python
@router.post("/", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
async def create_new_tour(...):
    try:
        # Business logic...
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error optimizing tour: {e}")
        # If optimization fails, still return the tour ID
        return {
            "tour_id": created_tour.id,
            "error": str(e)
        }
```

### 4.2 Graceful Degradation

For operations that depend on external services, the system implements graceful degradation:

```python
def call_route_optimization_api(body: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        # Call the API...
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Route Optimization API error: {e}")
        # Return a fallback response that allows the system to continue
        return {"routes": []}
```

### 4.3 Logging for Troubleshooting

The system uses extensive logging to aid in troubleshooting:

```python
logging.info(f"Collecting SMS feedback for task {task_id}, visit {visit_id}")
# ...
logging.info(f"Notifying listing agent {property_visit.sellside_agent_name} about feedback for {property_visit.address}")
```

## 5. Testing Patterns

### 5.1 Unit Testing with Mocks

For unit testing, the system mocks external dependencies:

```python
def test_optimize_tour():
    # Arrange
    tour = Mock(spec=Tour)
    properties = [...]
    agent_home = "123 Main St"
    
    # Mock external dependencies
    geocode_address_mock = Mock(return_value={"lat": 1.0, "lng": 1.0})
    call_api_mock = Mock(return_value={"routes": [...]})
    
    with patch("app.services.optimization_service.geocode_address", geocode_address_mock):
        with patch("app.services.optimization_service.call_route_optimization_api", call_api_mock):
            # Act
            result = optimize_tour(tour, properties, agent_home)
            
            # Assert
            assert "schedule" in result
            assert len(result["schedule"]) == len(properties)
```

### 5.2 Integration Testing

For integration testing, the system tests the interaction between components:

```python
def test_create_tour_endpoint():
    # Arrange
    client = TestClient(app)
    
    # Act
    response = client.post(
        "/tours/",
        params={...},
        json=[...]
    )
    
    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "tour_id" in response.json()
```

### 5.3 End-to-End Testing

For end-to-end testing, the system tests complete workflows:

```python
def test_complete_tour_workflow():
    # Arrange
    client = TestClient(app)
    
    # Act - Create tour
    response = client.post("/tours/", ...)
    tour_id = response.json()["tour_id"]
    
    # Act - Get property visits
    response = client.get(f"/property-visits/?tour_id={tour_id}")
    visit_id = response.json()[0]["visit_id"]
    
    # Act - Record arrival
    client.put(f"/property-visits/{visit_id}/arrival")
    
    # Act - Record departure
    client.put(f"/property-visits/{visit_id}/departure")
    
    # Act - Get feedback
    response = client.get(f"/feedback/?visit_id={visit_id}")
    
    # Assert
    assert len(response.json()) > 0
```

## 6. Extending the System

### 6.1 Adding New Task Types

To add a new task type, follow these steps:

1. Add the new task type to the TaskType enum:

   ```python
   class TaskType(str, Enum):
       PROPERTY_TOUR = "property_tour"
       FEEDBACK_COLLECTION = "feedback_collection"
       NEW_TASK_TYPE = "new_task_type"
   ```

2. Create a factory function for the new task type:

   ```python
   def create_new_task_type_task(visit_id: str, scheduled_time: str) -> Task:
       task = TaskCreate(
           visit_id=visit_id,
           task_type="new_task_type",
           status="scheduled",
           scheduled_time=scheduled_time
       )
       return create_task(task)
   ```

3. Implement a handler for the new task type in the appropriate service:

   ```python
   async def handle_new_task_type(task_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       task = get_task(task_id)
       if not task:
           return {"error": "Task not found"}
       
       # Task-specific logic...
       
       return {"status": "task_handled", "task_id": task_id}
   ```

4. Add an API endpoint for the new task type:

   ```python
   @router.post("/new-task-type", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
   async def create_new_task_type_endpoint(visit_id: str, scheduled_time: str):
       task = create_new_task_type_task(visit_id, scheduled_time)
       return {"task_id": task.id, "status": task.status}
   ```

### 6.2 Implementing New Optimization Strategies

To add a new optimization strategy:

1. Create a new function in the optimization service:

   ```python
   def optimize_tour_custom_strategy(
       tour: Tour,
       properties: List[Dict[str, Any]],
       agent_home: str
   ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       # Custom optimization logic...
       return result
   ```

2. Modify the optimize_tour function to accept a strategy parameter:

   ```python
   def optimize_tour(
       tour: Tour,
       properties: List[Dict[str, Any]],
       agent_home: str,
       strategy: str = "default"
   ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       if strategy == "custom":
           return optimize_tour_custom_strategy(tour, properties, agent_home)
       else:
           # Default optimization logic...
           return result
   ```

3. Update the API endpoint to accept the strategy parameter:

   ```python
   @router.post("/", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
   async def create_new_tour(
       agent_id: str,
       start_time: str,
       end_time: str,
       agent_home: str,
       properties: List[Dict[str, Any]],
       strategy: str = "default"
   ):
       # Create tour...
       optimization_result = optimize_tour(created_tour, properties, agent_home, strategy)
       # Return result...
   ```

### 6.3 Adding New Feedback Processing Approaches

To implement a new feedback processing approach:

1. Create a new function in the feedback service:

   ```python
   async def process_feedback_with_new_approach(raw_feedback: str) -> str:
       # New processing logic...
       return processed_feedback
   ```

2. Modify the process_feedback function to accept an approach parameter:

   ```python
   async def process_feedback(
       feedback_id: str,
       approach: str = "default"
   ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       feedback = get_feedback(feedback_id)
       if not feedback:
           return {"error": "Feedback not found"}
       
       raw_feedback = feedback.raw_feedback or ""
       
       if approach == "new":
           processed_feedback = await process_feedback_with_new_approach(raw_feedback)
       else:
           processed_feedback = await summarize_feedback_with_ai(raw_feedback)
       
       add_processed_feedback(feedback_id, processed_feedback)
       await notify_listing_agent(feedback_id)
       
       return {"status": "feedback_processed", "feedback_id": feedback_id}
   ```

3. Update the API endpoint to accept the approach parameter:

   ```python
   @router.put("/{feedback_id}/process", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
   async def process_feedback_endpoint(feedback_id: str, approach: str = "default"):
       result = await process_feedback(feedback_id, approach)
       return result
   ```

## 7. Future Architectural Considerations

### 7.1 Microservices Architecture

As the system grows, consider splitting it into microservices:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Gateway] --> B[Tour Service]
    A --> C[Feedback Service]
    A --> D[Notification Service]
    A --> E[Optimization Service]
    
    B --> F[(Tour Database)]
    C --> G[(Feedback Database)]
    E --> H[Google Cloud APIs]
    D --> I[Email/SMS Services]
```

This would provide:

- Better scalability for individual components
- Independent deployment of services
- Technology diversity where appropriate
- Isolation of failures

### 7.2 Event Sourcing

For more complex requirements around audit trails and system state, consider implementing event sourcing:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Commands] --> B[Command Handlers]
    B --> C[Events]
    C --> D[Event Store]
    C --> E[Event Handlers]
    E --> F[Read Models]
    F --> G[Queries]
```

This would provide:

- Complete audit history of all state changes
- Ability to reconstruct the system state at any point in time
- Better support for debugging and troubleshooting
- Improved scalability for read operations

### 7.3 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

For systems with complex querying requirements, consider implementing CQRS:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] --> B[Commands]
    A --> C[Queries]
    
    B --> D[Command Handlers]
    D --> E[Write Database]
    
    C --> F[Query Handlers]
    F --> G[Read Database]
    
    E -.-> H[Sync Process]
    H -.-> G
```

This would provide:

- Optimized data models for reads and writes
- Better performance for complex queries
- Simplified command processing
- Improved scalability

### 7.4 Serverless Architecture

For cost optimization and automatic scaling, consider serverless architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Gateway] --> B[Tour Lambda]
    A --> C[Feedback Lambda]
    A --> D[Notification Lambda]
    A --> E[Optimization Lambda]
    
    B --> F[DynamoDB]
    C --> F
    B --> G[SQS/EventBridge]
    G --> C
    C --> G
    G --> D
```

This would provide:

- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Pay-per-use cost model
- Zero server maintenance
- Built-in high availability
