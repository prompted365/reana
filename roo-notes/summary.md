```

### Key Capabilities

- **Tour Optimization**: Creates efficient property viewing schedules
- **Task Management**: Maps API "shipments" to discrete tour workflow tasks
- **Feedback Collection**: Collects and processes buyer feedback in real-time
- **Agent Notifications**: Notifies listing agents about property feedback
- **Tour Journal**: Maintains a chronological record of visits and feedback

## Core Architecture

REanna Router employs a layered architecture with a task-based workflow model:

1. **API Layer** (FastAPI Routes): Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and integrations
3. **Model Layer**: Defines data structures and database operations
4. **Database Layer**: Provides data persistence using SQLite

The **task-based architecture** is a key innovation, mapping Google Cloud Fleet Routing "shipments" to discrete tasks in a property tour workflow:

- **Tours**: Represent a complete property viewing schedule
- **Property Visits**: Individual stops at properties within a tour
- **Tasks**: Discrete activities associated with property visits (touring, feedback collection)
- **Feedback**: Buyer feedback collected via various methods

## Key Components Overview

### Models

| Model | Purpose | Key Functions |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Tour | Represents a complete tour schedule | create_tour, get_tour, update_tour |
| PropertyVisit | Represents a stop at a property | create_property_visit, record_arrival, record_departure |
| Task | Represents discrete activities | create_task, update_task_status, get_tasks_by_visit |
| Feedback | Stores buyer feedback | create_feedback, process_feedback, mark_feedback_as_sent |

### Services

| Service | Purpose | Key Features |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Optimization Service | Optimizes tour routes | Geocoding, route optimization, visit duration calculation |
| Feedback Service | Collects and processes feedback | SMS/voice feedback collection, AI-based processing |
| Notification Service | Sends notifications | Agent notifications, tour summaries, feedback alerts |

### API Routes

- **/tours/**: Create and manage tours
- **/property-visits/**: Manage property visits, record arrivals/departures
- **/tasks/**: Create and manage tasks of different types
- **/feedback/**: Submit and process feedback

        string sent_to_agent
    }
```

### Core Workflows

1. **Tour Creation & Optimization**:
   - Agent provides list of properties and preferences
   - System geocodes addresses
   - Google Route Optimization API calculates optimal route
   - System creates property visits and tasks
   - Optimized schedule is returned to agent

2. **Tour Execution**:
   - Agent records arrival/departure at each property
   - Tasks are automatically updated (scheduled → in_progress → completed)
   - Feedback collection is triggered after completed visits
   - Listing agents are notified about feedback

3. **Feedback Processing**:
   - System collects feedback via SMS/voice
   - AI processing extracts key points and sentiment
   - Processed feedback is sent to listing agents
   - Feedback is stored in the tour journal

## Design Patterns & Architectural Considerations

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Repository Pattern**: For database operations
2. **Factory Pattern**: For creating model instances
3. **Strategy Pattern**: For route optimization approaches
