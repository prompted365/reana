# Rollout API Future Integration Opportunities

## Overview

This document outlines the future integration opportunities for expanding the REanna Router CRM integration through the Rollout API platform. Based on our examination of the Rollout API specifications and the GoHighLevel CRM endpoints, we've identified several high-value integration points that would enhance the system's capabilities.

## Rollout API Integration Paths

The Rollout API provides several key integration paths that we've not yet fully leveraged:

### 1. Automation Management

The `/api/automations` endpoints allow for creating and managing automations between REanna Router and different CRM systems. We should explore:

- **Custom Workflow Triggers**: Creating automations that trigger based on specific tour/property events
- **Multi-step Workflows**: Building complex workflows that coordinate actions across multiple systems
- **Blueprint-based Automation**: Using the blueprintKey parameter to standardize automations across deployments

```json
// Example automation creation payload
{
  "name": "Tour Schedule Sync Automation",
  "active": true,
  "trigger": {
    "appKey": "reanna-router",
    "triggerKey": "tour_scheduled",
    "credentialKey": "reanna-router-creds",
    "inputParams": {
      "tourId": "{{tourId}}"
    }
  },
  "action": {
    "appKey": "gohighlevel",
    "actionKey": "create_calendar_event",
    "credentialKey": "ghl-credentials",
    "inputParams": {
      "locationId": "{{locationId}}",
      "title": "{{tourName}}",
      "startTime": "{{tourStartTime}}",
      "endTime": "{{tourEndTime}}",
      "description": "{{tourDescription}}"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. GoHighLevel Calendar Integration

The GoHighLevel Calendars API provides rich functionality for calendar management that would enhance tour scheduling:

- **Calendar Groups**: Create and manage calendar groups for different agent teams
- **Calendar Appointments**: Sync REanna Router tours directly into GHL calendars
- **Calendar Availability**: Check agent availability for tour scheduling
- **Two-way Synchronization**: Update tour information when calendar events change

```json
// Example calendar appointment creation
{
  "calendarId": "{{calendarId}}",
  "title": "Property Tour: {{address}}",
  "startTime": "2025-04-01T10:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2025-04-01T11:00:00Z",
  "notes": "Tour with {{clientName}} at {{address}}",
  "contactId": "{{contactId}}",
  "reminders": [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "time": 60
    },
    {
      "type": "sms",
      "time": 30
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. GoHighLevel Contacts API

The Contacts API allows for bidirectional syncing of contact information:

- **Contact Creation**: Create contacts in GHL when a new tour is scheduled
- **Contact Updates**: Update contact information when client details change
- **Contact Tagging**: Apply tags based on property interests or tour participation
- **Contact Activity Tracking**: Log tour attendance as contact activities

### 4. GoHighLevel Conversations API

Leverage the Conversations API to enhance client communications:

- **Automated Messaging**: Send automated confirmation and reminder messages
- **Conversation History**: Track client conversations related to property tours
- **Omnichannel Communication**: Communicate via SMS, email, or chat from a single interface
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze feedback messages for client sentiment

### 5. Custom Trigger Events

Implement custom trigger events for the Rollout API:

- **Tour Status Changes**: Trigger actions when tour status changes
- **Feedback Submission**: Trigger actions when property feedback is submitted
- **Circuit Breaker State Changes**: Trigger notifications when integration health changes
- **Rate Limit Warnings**: Trigger actions when approaching API rate limits

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Enhanced Calendar Synchronization

1. Implement the GoHighLevel calendar integration:
   - Sync tours to calendar appointments
   - Update tours when calendar events change
   - Implement real-time availability checking

2. Create monitoring for calendar sync operations:
   - Calendar-specific circuit breakers
   - Sync status tracking in the dashboard
   - Failed calendar sync retry operations

### Phase 2: Contact Management

1. Implement contact synchronization:
   - Create/update contacts based on tour participants
   - Sync contact activity with tour history
   - Implement contact tagging based on properties viewed

2. Enhance the dashboard with contact monitoring:
   - Contact sync status
   - Failed contact operations management
   - Contact activity visualization

### Phase 3: Conversation and Messaging

1. Implement conversation integration:
   - Automated tour notifications
   - Feedback requests
   - Follow-up messaging

2. Extend monitoring to conversation operations:
   - Message delivery tracking
   - Conversation sync status
   - Failed message retry capabilities

## Technical Considerations

### Authentication and Security

- Implement key rotation for Rollout API credentials
- Set up credential backup and disaster recovery
- Implement more granular permission controls

### Error Handling and Resilience

- Expand circuit breaker patterns to handle connector-specific failures
- Implement more sophisticated rate limit handling with predictive throttling
- Create connector-specific error handlers for each CRM system

### Performance Optimization

- Implement batched operations for high-volume syncs
- Set up caching for frequently accessed CRM data
- Use webhook-based synchronization where possible to reduce polling

### Monitoring and Analytics

- Track connector-specific metrics for each CRM system
- Implement usage analytics for API utilization optimization
- Set up predictive alerts for potential integration issues

## MCP Tools Enhancement

Expand our MCP server capabilities to include:

1. **CRM Schema Analyzer**: Tool to analyze and map CRM data structures
2. **Integration Health Checker**: Tool to verify all integration points are functioning
3. **Data Sync Validator**: Tool to validate data consistency across systems
4. **Connector Config Generator**: Tool to generate connector configurations based on customer needs

## Conclusion

By leveraging the full capabilities of the Rollout API and GoHighLevel connectors, we can create a comprehensive CRM integration that handles the entire property tour lifecycle, from scheduling to feedback collection and follow-up. The monitoring dashboard we've implemented provides the foundation for observability across these expanded integration points.
